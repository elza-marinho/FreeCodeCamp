      <h2>About</h2>
      <p><strong>Chesney Henry "Chet" Baker Jr.</strong> (December 23, 1929 â€“ May 13, 1988) was an American jazz trumpeter and vocalist. He is known for major innovations within the cool jazz subgenre leading him to be nicknamed the "prince of cool"<br>Baker earned much attention and critical praise through the 1950s, particularly for albums featuring his vocals (Chet Baker Sings, It Could Happen to You). Jazz historian Dave Gelly described the promise of Baker's early career as "James Dean, Sinatra, and Bix, rolled into one." His well-publicized drug habit also drove his notoriety and fame. Baker was in and out of jail frequently before enjoying a career resurgence in the late 1970s and 1980s.</p>
<p> Born and raised in a musical household in Yale, Oklahoma. His father, Chesney Baker Sr., was a professional guitarist, and his mother, Vera Moser, was a pianist who worked in a perfume factory.Baker began his musical career singing in a church choir. In 1940, due to the lack of work for Chet's father in Oklahoma, the family moved to Glendale, California. When Chet was thirteen his father brought home a trombone. The trombone didn't work out very well because Chet was so small compared to the trombone. Chet, Sr. took away the trombone and replaced it with a trumpet.

      <p>In 1952, Baker joined the Gerry Mulligan Quartet.He made his acting debut in the film Hell's Horizon, released in the fall of 1955. In 1956 he completed an eight-month tour of Europe, where he recorded Chet Baker in Europe.<br> During the 1960s, he was imprisoned in Italy on drug charges and was expelled from Germany and the UK on drug-related offences. From 1978 until his death in 1988, Baker lived and played almost exclusively in Europe, returning to the U.S. once a year for a few performances. This was Baker's most prolific era as a recording artist.</p>
      <p> Early on May 13, 1988, Baker was found dead on the street below his room in Hotel Prins Hendrik, Amsterdam, with serious wounds to his head, apparently having fallen from the second-story window. Baker is buried at the Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California, next to his father.
